<!-- Cracking the Coding Interview / By Omar Hamed / In Bython -->

==============================================
<!-- Section I : The Interview Process -->
==============================================

=> so in interiew the interviewer looking to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before.

=> you may got a help from the interviewer or a hint , it's normal and doesn't really mean that you're doing poorly.

 * <!-- your preformance depends on those : --> 

 1- Analytical Skills . 
 2- Coding Skills .
 3- Technical Knowledge/Computer Science Fundementals .
 4- Experince .
 5- Culture fit/Communication Skills .  

 => the weighting mainlly based on question, interviewer, role.

 <!-- Something You Should Know -->

1- It's acceptable that good people could be rejected , it's normal that the company miss the could people , and sometimes there's the people hoe do well in the interview but are not in fact very well.

2- Problem sovling skills are valuable : if are good at them , that mean's to company that you are smart and you can preduce valuable things to them .

3- Basic data strucure and algorithem knowledge is useful : many interviewers would argue that basic computer scince knowledge is very useful. understanding  trees , graph, ..etc come up periodically. when it's does ,it's really valuable .


<!-- NOTE -->
===> the fisrt four sections {the interview process , Behind the scenes , special situations , Before the interview},
are you can call, it's for you , you can read it or not .
so i wiil leave to u .
i will start from {Behavioral Questions}
=> i will just shortcut only the writable and impotrant things , if you need more details you can read the book by your self.
thanks, i hope that will be usefull.
